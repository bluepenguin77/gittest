If you never gave a damn, raise your hand
‘Cause I’m about to set trip, vacation plans
I’m on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin’ finger (Finger), prostate exam (‘Xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar’s pants, I’m on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I’m still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin’ out, I only get more handsome and flyer
I got ’em passin’ out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw
‘Cause I caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
‘Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)
